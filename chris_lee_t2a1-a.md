# <mark>Question 3</mark>: Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology
Agile project management is a methodology used by companies to increase efficiency, profits, deliverables and to overall ensure that large teams are able to move forward with their work with reduced internal roadblocks + excellent communication. This methodology is introduced through a number of factors/exercises, each responsible for monitoring progress of different aspects of the teams/company. The core components of the Agile methodology are:
- User stories
- Sprints
- Meetings/Standups
- Agile Boards
- Product Backlogs
- Roles  

### User stories:  
User stories are used to help companies understand the perspective of their users. To elaborate, the company will create hypothetical stories that are from the point-of-view of the user. These stories list key factors such as:
- what type of user they are
- what features they like and would like to see implemented
- what benefit the project can/does provide to them  

With these key points in mind, a company is able to envision what the current project needs to implement in order to meet this criteria. These dot points act as the structure for what the latest feature will include, because of this methodology, companies are able to provide updates that include features that are actually wanted/needed by their users.  

### Sprints:  
Sprints are small cycles of development where the team is given a goal/where they work towards the release of a feature/program/app etc.  
Typically, they range from 1 week to 4 weeks in duration and the entire point of the sprint is to produce/finish and release a useable product. (Note: Sprints are not exclusive to the end of development/release stage, sprints can be used with the aim of finishing a feature for an overall larger piece of software.)  

### Meetings/Standups:  
For increased efficiency, under Agile methodology, teams break up into smaller groups with the goal of allocating these groups to assignments in which they are proficient and are able to complete effectively. Because of the introduction of multiple teams, there needs to be a way to ensure the overall project is reaching targeted milestones on time. This is where standups come in.  
**Daily standups** (scrums) are short, daily meetings where teams talk about what theyre working on, what they've completed and what theyre struggling with/what roadblocks they are facing. This is an incredible way to delegate company resources to areas that are underperforming/falling behind.  
**Sprint Planning** is a longer style of meeting in which the team will discuss what should be included in the sprint cycle.  
**Sprint Retrospective** Once a sprint cycle concludes, the team will discuss what they achieved, what worked/didnt work and how the sprint cycles can be improved upon moving forward.  

### Agile boards:  
An agile board can be anything from a physical whiteboard to a website like trello. The purpose of the boards is to visually organise the project. By using this, companies are able to split the development process into chunks, because it is visually focused, it is easy to follow and understand where progression is in relation to completion.  

### Product backlog:  
As the company continues to recieve requests and feedback, potential features will amount to a large list. These potential features live inside the product backlog until the company is ready to introduce them into the sprint cycles. The backlogs can include things such as: 
- bug fixes
- feature ideas
- non-functional requirements
- any outlining work needed to release/update and improve functional software

### Roles:  
Because Agile project management implements so many new ideas and further splits the team into smaller groups, new team roles are created to help manage everything. These roles include, but are not limited to: 
- Scrum Master
- Project Owner
- Team Members 
- Stakeholders

#### Scrum master:
These people ensure the sprints stay on track by tracking progress and regulary scheduling meetings. Theyre responsible for communicating and removing roadblocks, as well as being the advocate for the group. 

#### Project owner(manager): 
This person outlines the goals of each sprint. They will adopt the perspective of the user and communicate that voice to the team to ensure goals stay aligned with projected work outcomes. 

#### Team members: 
These are the grunts that do the work in each sprint cycle, these teams need to remain self organized to ensure maximum efficiency. 

#### Stakeholders: 
These people are directly effected by the outcome of the release of the product, they may provide funding or extra information to developers, but typically, they have no say in the smaller operations of day-to-day tasks.  

# <mark>Question 4</mark>: Provide an overview and description of a standard source control workflow:
Source control workflow is a practice involving the use of software to track versions/progress of a product/program etc. Typically, as a product goes through its development stages, many things will be added, removed, edited or even completely redesigned. This process can introduce bugs/break functionality of the program/product. To prevent this, source control software is used to establish a functional base for the program. To elaborate, in the early stages of development, a "master" branch is created. This branch is created at a point where the basic program functionality is there and working as expected. After the master branch is created, individual "branches" are created as an extension. These branches are where new features are added, tested and completed. The benefit to this structure is when a branch is broken, full of bugs etc, the master branch of the program remains unaffected. As the branch reaches expected functionality and testing is completed, developers can merge the new branch into the master branch. Once merged, the master branch is updated to include the new branch and the base for the master branch continues from the point of the merge.  
Another key feature of a source control workflow (particulary git, in collaboration with github) is the ability to add, commit and push changes.  
For example:  
- "Github "is a cloud based hosting service that allows users to create and manage repositories.
-  "Git" on the other hand, is the version control software itself.  

When used in conjuction, like i am with this assignment, users are able to add and commit changes they have made to a project and then further push those changes to the remote repository. To simplify, if used in a team, the remote repository would be utilised in such a way that allows multiple developers to complete seperate sections of work and further push those changes so they are available remotely to the rest of the team. Without version control software like the 2 just mentioned, any changes made by devlopers would only be accessible locally, this means a large amount of work would be introduced in relation to collecting all of that work, piling it all together and then trying to test if it is functional when grouped together.  

To simplify this process, i will outline a typical cycle of software version control using dot points:  
- Repository is created remotely and linked locally
- A barebones functional program is developed (Think along the lines of "Version 1")
- Version 1 is the master branch, however, it needs a new feature to be added
- A branch is created (Think along the lines of playing around with a new feature without any commitment)  
- The branch undergoes developement and reaches a point where it is ready to be included as a feature of the project
- The branch is merged to the master branch  
- Once merged, the basis for the master branch moves forward. (Think "Version 1.1"  From this point forward, features and new branches are based off of "Version 1.1")
