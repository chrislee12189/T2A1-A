# Question 2: Identify a database management system (DBMS) commonly used in web applications (including Flask) and discuss the pros and cons of this database
# <mark>Question 3</mark>: Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology
Agile project management is a methodolody used by companies to increase efficiency, profits, deliverables and to overall ensure that large teams are able to move forward with their work with reduced internal roadblocks + excellent communication. This methodology is introduced through a number of factors/exercises, each responsible for monitoring progress of different aspects of the teams/company. The core components of the Agile methodology are:
- User stories
- Sprints
- Meetings/Standups
- Agile Boards
- Product Backlogs
- Roles  

### User stories:  
User stories are used to help companies understand the perspective of their users. To elaborate, the company will create hypothetical stories that are from the point-of-view of the user. These stories list key factors such as:
- what type of user they are
- what features they like and would like to see implemented
- what benefit the project can/does provide to them  

With these key points in mind, a company is able to envision what the current project needs to implement in order to meet this criteria. These dot points act as the structure for what the latest feature will include, because of this methodology, companies are able to provide updates that include features that are actually wanted/needed by their users.  

### Sprints:  
Sprints are small cycles of development where the team is given a goal/where they work towards the release of a feature/program/app etc.  
Typically, they range from 1 week to 4 weeks in duration and the entire point of the sprint is to produce/finish and release a useable product. (Note: Sprints are not exclusive to the end of development/release stage, sprints can be used with the aim of finishing a feature for an overall larger piece of software.)  

### Meetings/Standups:  
For increased efficiency, under Agile methodology, teams break up into smaller teams with the goal of allocating teams to assignments in which they are proficient and are able to complete effectively. Because of the introduction of multiple teams, there needs to be a way to ensure the overall project is reaching targeted milestones on time. This is where standups come in.  
**Daily standups** (scrums) are short, daily meetings where teams talk about what theyre working on, what they've completed and what theyre struggling with/what roadblocks they are facing. This is an incredible way to delegate company resources to areas that are underperforming/falling behind.  
**Sprint Planning** is a longer style of meeting in which the team will discuss what should be included in the sprint cycle.  
**Sprint Retrospective** Once a sprint cycle concludes, the team will discuss what they achieved, what worked/didnt work and how the sprint cycles can be improved upon moving forward.  

### Agile boards:  
An agile board can be anything from a physical whiteboard to a website like trello. The purpose of the boards is to 
# <mark>Question 4</mark>: Provide an overview and description of a standard source control workflow
# <mark>Question 5</mark>: Provide an overview and description of a standard software testing process (e.g. manual testing)
# Question 6: Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security and how they relate to the project
# Question 7: Discuss common methods of protecting information and data and how you would apply them to the project
# Question 8: Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data and how they can be met for the project
# <mark>Question 9</mark>: Describe the structural aspects of the relational database model. Your description should include information about the structure in which data is stored and how relations are represented in that structure.
# <mark>Question 10</mark>: Describe the integrity aspects of the relational database model. Your description should include information about the types of data integrity and how they can be enforced in a relational database.
# <mark>Question 11</mark>: 	Describe the manipulative aspects of the relational database model. Your description should include information about the ways in which data is manipulated (added, removed, changed, and retrieved) in a relational database.
# Question 12: 	Conduct research into a web application (app) and answer the following parts:  
- ## A. List and describe the software used by the app.
- ## B. Describe the hardware used to host the app.
- ## C. Describe the interaction of technologies within the app
- ## D. Describe the way data is structured within the app
- ## E. Identify entities which must be tracked by the app
- ## F. Identify the relationships and associations between the entities you have identified in part (e)
- ## G. Design a schema using an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) appropriate for the database of this website (assuming a relational database model)
